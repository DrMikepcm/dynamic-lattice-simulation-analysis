Here are the next steps for your paper, formatted for a formal manuscript. This roadmap outlines the remaining simulations and analysis required to build a complete scientific argument.

### 1. Mass Segregation Simulation

**Objective:** To test the hypothesis that heavier particles will migrate toward the core of a stable geometric well. This test validates the relationship between particle mass and curvature generation, a core component of your model.

**Methodology:**
* Set the `BASE_REPULSION_STRENGTH` and `BASE_THERMAL_ENERGY` to stable, intermediate values determined by your previous simulations.
* Run the simulation for a sufficient number of steps to allow the system to reach an equilibrium state.
* At regular intervals (e.g., every 100 steps), calculate and record the average mass of particles in concentric rings from the core's center.
* The primary data for this section will be a graph plotting average particle mass versus distance from the core over time.

**Falsifiable Test:** If the simulation shows no significant correlation between particle mass and distance from the core, the hypothesis is falsified.

### 2. Analysis and Theoretical Synthesis

**Objective:** To synthesize the data from all three simulations (repulsion, thermal, and mass segregation) and formally transition your model from a simulation to a predictive framework.

**Methodology:**
* **Repulsion Data:** Analyze the `repulsion_test_results.csv` data to confirm the inverse relationship between repulsion strength and core density. This validates the pressure term in your mathematical model.
* **Thermal Data:** Analyze the thermal simulation results to confirm that thermal energy primarily affects the outer "buffer" region of the core, while the innermost core's average density remains stable.
* **Mass Segregation Data:** Analyze the data from this simulation to determine if mass segregation occurs, supporting the role of particle mass in deepening the geometric wells.
* **Continuous Field Equations:** Formalize the simulation rules into continuous field equations, as previously discussed. This section will be the core of your paper's theoretical contribution. The equations will describe the time evolution of the density field $\rho(x, y, t)$ and the curvature field $C(x, y, t)$.

### 3. Astrophysical Connection

**Objective:** To apply your validated theoretical framework to real astronomical phenomena and make a falsifiable prediction about dwarf galaxies.

**Methodology:**
* **Parameterization:** Use observed data from a specific dwarf galaxy (e.g., its stellar mass and size) to set the initial conditions and scaling factors for your continuous field equations.
* **Prediction:** Use the equations to predict an observable property, such as the dwarf galaxy's density profile or its rotation curve.
* **Falsifiable Test:** Compare your model's prediction with the actual astronomical observations. If your prediction matches the observations, the model gains significant scientific credibility. If it fails, the model is falsified, and you would conclude the paper with a discussion of its limitations and avenues for future research.

By following these steps, you will construct a robust scientific paper that presents a new model, tests it rigorously, and then attempts to apply it to a real-world astrophysical problem.
